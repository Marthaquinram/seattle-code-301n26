# React and Component-Based Architecture

## Overview

Today we will be covering some new topics and reviewing concepts you should already be familiar with.

We will spend some time reviewing the concepts from the prework. We will also discuss several new topics: `create-react-app` and component-based architecture.

## Daily Plan

- Overview of 301
  - Due Dates in Canvas
    - Retros are always due by midnight the same day they are assigned.
      - I want you to reflect on your most recent learning and have that fresh in your mind.
      - these CANNOT be late
    - Readings are due right before class starts
      - readings are assigned the same day as the labs
        - except for the Regex101 reading...
      - there is no penatly for turning in a late reading assignment
    - Code Challenges and Labs are due no later than the start of the next class day
      - EXAMPLE: Monday/Tuesday's CC & Labs will be due no later than Thursday at 6:30pm.
      - EXAMPLE: Thursday/Saturday's CC & Labs will be due no later than Monday at 6:30pm.
    - Career Assignments
      - Turn these in whenever you can.
      - You will not lose points for late submissions on these.
      - HOWEVER, do NOT fall behind and have a bunch of Career Assignments due at the end of the 9 weeks.
    - Feedback Assigments
      - due every week by Sunday midnight.
      - I suggest you complete the Feedback assignment on Saturdays.
      - Please do not skip these!
        - They are easy points!
        - We take your feedback VERY seriously and discuss it among the instructional staff every single week.

    - More Paired Programming!
    - Career Coaching
      - More career assignments
    - Lab Assignments
      - Trello for a lot of weekly project work flow
    - Grading standards
      - Turn in your Labs and Retros!
      - Take care of your TAs by following instructions posted by Phil every week in Slack
      - Resubmissions allowed up until Project Week(s) start

- Review of prework
  - Classes
    - Classes are the building blocks for React
      - They are part of ES6 and allow for Object Oriented Programming
    - A blueprint for creating objects
      - A system where we can define objects in relation to each other using subclasses using the keyword extends.
    - [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) on MDN
  - Arrow Functions
    - multiple ways to create a function
      - mostly been doing function declarations in 201
      - function expresions are another way and arrow functions are one way to write a function expression
    - function expression vs. declaration
      - Function declarations load before any code is executed while Function expressions load only when the interpreter reaches that line of code.
      - Similar to the var statement, function declarations are hoisted to the top of other code. Function expressions arenâ€™t hoisted, which allows them to retain a copy of the local variables from the scope where they were defined.
      - benifits of function expressions
        - in closures - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qikxEIxsXco>
        - as an argument to another function
        - to immediately invoke your function
    - allow us to write concise one line functions
    - the contextual this is not bound to the function if you use an arrow function, it will bubble up to the next non-arrow function

- Discussion of `create-react-app`
  - CRA is a library that builds a working React application how to the box, ready to be customized!
- Discussion of component-based architecture
  - React and Component-Based UI
    - <https://www.w3schools.com/REACT/DEFAULT.ASP>
    - Why?
      - React is hugely in demand in the industry
      - Component based architecture is easier to test and reuse
      - dynamicly updates application state without requiring a page reload
      - dev advantages
        - reusable parts
        - separation of concerns
    - What?
      - React (angular and vue) are component based libraries that allow us to build applications using this technique
      - Bind state/data to the DOM, they update the dom for us!!
        - react rerenders content when state changes by using a Virtual DOM
      - We treat components like they are html elements `<Header />`
      - Modularity
        - each component is it's own module, or block of code, that we can make available in another component
        - export the component from it's file, and import it where you want to use it
          - you can also import css and other files to a component module
    - How
      - WRRC
        - a request is made in the address bar for our website resource and the files are served
        - who is the client, who is the server?
      - Use `npx create-react-app <application_name>` to start your project
      - refer to the reactAppRemove.md if you want to clean up the file structure before you start
      - JSX (syntax extension) allows us to write html markup in javascript
    - to start your React server
      - `npm start`
    - to close down your React server
      - control + c
- Introduction to code challenges
  - Daily "Shred Talks" will introduce you to a new javascript coding concept, setting you up to complete the daily "Code Challenge" series.
  - Make sure you are in the javascript folder of your DSA repo before running any javascript commands in the terminal.
  - Don't forget to work on a new branch!
  - Don't forget to pull down the new challenges!
  - npm run get-challenge 01
  - You only need to run this command ONCE to grab all of the Code Challenges for this assignment.
  - Check out the how-to-solve-a-code-challenge.md file for tips and tricks on how to break down a code challenge and solve it.
- Introduction of code challenge topic

- Lab prep

- Describe and Define:
  - Component-based architecture
  - React
  - `create-react-app`
  - JavaScript classes
  - Arrow functions
- Gain an understanding of scope with arrow functions
- Gain an understanding of context, scope, "this", and the "new" keyword
- Gain an understanding of the core concepts of React and how to create a basic React application
- Be able to create a basic React application using `create-react-app`
- Understand component-based architecture and be able to build a simple component-based React application

## Notes

1. What is React?
1. What are components?
1. What is the difference between an arrow function and a function declaration?
1. Turning a function declaration into an arrow function:

   ```javascript
   function doSomething(name) {
     // Do something
   }

   doSomething = (name) => {
     // Do something
   }

   // Or make it a one liner!
   doSomething = (name) => // Do something small
   ```

1. Difference between a constructor function and a class:

   ```javascript
   // constructor
   function Cat(name) {
     this.name = name;
     this.fluffy = true;
   }

   Cat.prototype.speak = function(){
     console.log(`${this.name} says meow`);
   }

   // to make a new instance
   const bob = new Cat('Bob');
   bob.speak();

   // class
   class Cat {
     constructor(name) {
       this.name = name;
       this.fluffy = true;
     }

     speak = () => console.log(`${this.name} says meow`);
   }

   // to make a new instance
   const bob = new Cat('bob');
   bob.speak();
   ```

1. Basic React Component Structure:

   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';

   class Something extends React.Component {
     render() {
       return(
          <section>
            <h1>Header for Something</h1>
            <p>Text that is all about Something.<p>
          </section>
       )
     }
   }

   export default Something
   ```
