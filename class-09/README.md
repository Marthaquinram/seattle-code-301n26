## Notes

1. What is a Promise?

- a Promise is an object in JavaScript that represents the eventual completion or failure of an async operation and it's resulting value.
- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise>

1. `async and await` - vs - `.then() and .catch()`

ES6 saw the introduction of the `Promise` object as well as new methods to handle the execution of these Promises: `then`, `catch`, and `finally`. But a year later, in ES7, the language added another approach and two new keywords: `async` and `await`.

- When returning a Promise inside an async function, you donâ€™t need to use await.
- <https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/11/comparison-async-await-versus-then-catch/>
- The difference is that in an async function, JavaScript will pause the function execution until the promise settles. With `then()`, the rest of the function will continue to execute but JavaScript won't execute the `.then()` callback until the promise settles.
- <https://dev.to/masteringjs/using-then-vs-async-await-in-javascript-2pma#:~:text=The%20difference%20is%20that%20in,JavaScript%20won't%20execute%20the%20.>

1. What is the difference between a Promise and using `.then()/.catch()`?

- `.then()` is a handler function that is called when a Promise is returned either fulfilled or rejected.
- `.catch()` is a method that calls an `onRejected` function to handle a rejected Promise.
- `.then` and `.catch` are methods and `Promise` is an object.

1. What is refactoring?

- it is the process of restructuring existing computer code changing the inner workings without changing its external behavior. Refactoring is intended to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software.

1. What is DRY code?

- DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF!
- This applies to both documentation and code!

1. Why do we modularize our code?

- DRY
- Our  `server.js` is getting pretty large!
- Our functions are big and doing multiple tasks
- Our code is unreadable
- Every API that we add to our app, is just going to continue to add to these problems...

  ```javaScript
  async function doSomething() {
    try{
      const results = await axios.get(url)
    }
    catch(err){
      console.error(err);
    }
  }

  // error handeling is built in with the .catch() so we don't need a try/catch
  function doSomething() {
    axios
      .get(url)
      .then(results => {
        // the results only exist within this code block
      })
      .catch(err => console.error(err))
  }
  ```

1. Modularizing a file on the server

  ```javaScript
  function doSomething(){
    // does something really cool
  }

  module.exports = doSomething
  ```

  - OR, it can be writen like this

  ```javaScript
  module.exports = () => {
    // does something really cool
  }
  ```

  - in the server file

  ```javaScript
  const doSomething = require('./path-to-doSomething');
  // the rest of the file
  ```

1. We can also export more than one function by putting it in an object

  ```javaScript
  module.exports = {
    doSomething: function(){
      // does something cool
    },

    doSomethingElse: function(){
      // does something else
    }
  }
  ```

  - to access a function from the object above in the server, we would...

  ```javaScript
  const doesStuffObject = require('./path-to-doesStuffObject');

  doesStuffObject.doSomething();
  doesStuffObject.doSomethingElse();
  ```

## Feedback Overview

- "My only feedback would be more lab time considering the scope of the assignment (especially with Lab 08). We had limited lab time this week with longer lectures"
- "I think the Trello board could include some additional small hints at certain places that could spark solutions."
- "Still behind and I keep feeling like I am barely treading water, yet I am understanding more and coming to realize how much I have already learned."
- "System errors, knowing that they happen all the time, I have come to accept them as as par for the course. Now I will simply become a pro on debugging.  Always a silver lining. "
- "How do we go about leaving notes on someone's GitHub for code review?"
- "The partner power hours seem to be simply a person talking about their life story for an hour a majority of the time. While it can be interesting, it's not usually all that enlightening outside of the usual "network more and also keep going". Hearing David Souther's talk about spaceX cloud infrastructure, even if it was beyond my understanding, was much more worthwhile to me than these motivational talks."
- "my brain is fried right now, I cant think of anything at the moment, but Im excited to be learning so many new stuff."
- "working in teams...Im constantly learning from them!"
- "I found working as a team very helpful."
- "I liked how we are starting to work with partners, even just for the beginning of the lab. It's nice to see how others see things and write code, I of course use that to my advantage and take some pointers."
- "I think another thing that may help is just challenging us students more in lecture? Kind of put us on the spot, I think that would help when learning new concepts and ideas."
