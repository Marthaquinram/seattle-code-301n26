import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom";
// At the core of every React Router application should be a router component. For web projects, react-router-dom provides <BrowserRouter> and <HashRouter> routers. The main difference between the two is the way they store the URL and communicate with your web server.
// A <BrowserRouter> uses regular URL paths. These are generally the best-looking URLs, but they require your server to be configured correctly. Specifically, your web server needs to serve the same page at all URLs that are managed client-side by React Router. Create React App supports this out of the box in development, and comes with instructions on how to configure your production server as well.
