# Updating Resources

## DEI Reminder

In our next class we will discuss Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.  Be sure to complete [the reading assignment](https://codefellows.github.io/code-301-guide/curriculum/class-14/DISCUSSION) before class begins in order to acheive full credit for the activity.

## Exam Preview

- Exam will take place on Saturday, June 11th.
- I will be giving a review lecture on Saturday morning before the exam.
- You will be given starter code that will have minor bugs in it. You will need to fix the bugs and then add some features onto the code.
- There will be tests that you can run so you will know if you have completed the tasks correctly.
- You will need to deploy both your front-end and back-end.
- You will have 4 hours to complete the exam.
- You must be present in Remo, sitting alone at a table while taking the exam.
- You may use any resource except for other people.
- If you are stuck on a "gituation", ask the instructor for assistance.
- TAs may not help you complete the exam.
- There will be an option for one retake if you happen to fail the exam the first try.

## Overview

Today we do the final step in full CRUD funtionality for our database. This step is to implement the ability to update records that exist in our database.

## Daily Plan

- Warm-up exercise
- Exam Preview
- Review code challenges
- Introduce new code challenges
  - repl.it demo: <https://replit.com/@HexxKing1/301n26-Code-Challenges-String-Manipulation#index.js>
- Creating, Deleting & Updating Resources
- Code demo
- Lab preview

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing lecture 13 of Code 301, students will:

- Describe and Define
  - UPDATE
  - PUT
- Be able to update a resources in a mongo database
- Be able to update a resource instantly in a React application and have that resource state persist on reload

## Notes

- Optional Chaining Operator `?.`
  - Optional chaining is a handy recent feature of JavaScript (introduced in ES2020) that lets you check for nullish values while accessing property values.
  - The optional chaining operator (?.) enables you to read the value of a property located deep within a chain of connected objects without having to check that each reference in the chain is valid.
  - This will become handy when building our UPDATE feature in React.
    - Think about how we can update a nested value within a state property...
    - If we start to update just one value within our Book object, it could cause our app to break due to a "nullish" value.
    - This is where the optional chaining operator comes in! It only cares that the Book object is valid and will allow us to continue to update a nested property inside of our Book object in order to save the new value in State.

1. Why do we need to talk about Diversity and Inclusion?

- teams work better while feeling comfortable with each other
- it's the "right" thing to do to treat people nice
- we are working with people!
- it's big world and lots of folx to share it!

1. What does the U stand for in CRUD?

- UPDATE
  - If you want to update a resource, what information do you need?
    - `_id`: you will need a way of identifying the resource
      - the _id is going to be sent in the params
    - the property you want to update and it's new value
      - the updated values will be sent body
  - What are the steps needed to make an update happen in the frontend?
    - create an update button that grabs the `_id` of the book that the button belongs to.
    - the update book reveals a form that will allow us to update properties
    - our update form will grab all the properties from the book that was clicked on and auto-fill the input fields for us.
    - our update form will create an object with the `_id` and the new values and pass it to the async function
    - async function to PUT the request.body to the URL
  - What are the steps needed to make an update happen in the backend?
    - grab the `_id` from the `request.params.id`
    - we need some kind of Mongoose method that updates our document in the database
    - we should pass the new updated book data along to the database
    - we want to return the newly updated book

- PATCH vs PUT
  - PATCH is another HTTP method that is used to update a document in MONGO however, it only updates SOME properties but not all the properties.
  - PUT updates the entire document in the database.

1. How do we find a record by id and update it in Mongoose?

- `Model.findByIdAndUpdate(id, update, options)`
  - <https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/model.html#model_Model.findByIdAndUpdate>
  - HINT: Look into the `new` option for your lab #13

1. Sending an axios request to update a record:
  ```javaScript
  const SERVER = 'http://localhost:3001';
  // id of the record to update
  const id = 2;
  // the entire record with the updated information
  const updatedRecord = {name: 'bobby', age: 105};

  axios.put(`${SERVER}/${id}`, { recordToUpdate: updatedRecord });
  ```

1. Updating a record server side:
  ```javaScript
  app.put('/someRoute/:id', callback);

  callback(request, response) {
    const record = request.body.recordToUpdate;
    const id = request.params.id;

    Model.findOneAndUpdate(id, record);
  }
  ```

1. Updating a record server side when the record is nested inside of a user object (like the books in the user)
  ```javaScript
  app.put('/someRoute/:index', callback);

  callback(request, response) {
    const email = request.body.email; // send the email in the body as well as the record
    const record = request.body.recordToUpdate;
    const index = request.query.params.index;

    Model.findOne({ email }, (err, person) => {
      if(err) console.error(err);
      // now that we have the user, we need to replace the record
      const newBooks = person.books.splice(index, 1, record);
      // replace the books array with the new books array
      person.books = newBooks;
      // save the updated person in the DB
      person.save()
    })
  }
  ```

## Feedback Overview

- "Still struggling with errors, yet i am getting them fixed at the rate i am breaking them so that's good."
- "Building our API to handle tasks has been fantastic, as has going back and re-looking at how to use objects a little deeper."
- "I just don't know anyone who would appreciate the pace. I think this program should be advertised as a certification program for experienced coders, not for total newbs...There's no time to digest and practice the small concepts before one is expected to perform by completing an extremely difficult (for a newb) lab."
- "The extra reviews we have been doing on Fridays for those who need it (me). Since we have been moving quick itâ€™s nice to taking that extra step back and re review everything "
- "Had a long weekend, but the video lecture from the last cohort was great. The students asked great questions too, so I feel like I didn't miss much."
- "I really like the demos because it just shows us the basics of what to do, then we have the challenging part of figuring out what to do with that info."
